# Heap
Max heap simulation written in C (Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS). Based on http://robin-thomas.github.io/max-heap/. The nodes of the heap contains the id and the amount of money of a bank's customer. Every time a customer deposits money, we insert a new node in the heap, if he is a new customer, or we update an existing node in the heap by adding the money in the total of amount of money, if he is an existing customer. Contains makefile: "make" to compile, "make clean" to delete object files and executable, "make run" to execute the program and "make check" to run valgrind to check for memory leaks.
